# LifeOS AI - Personal Operating System

**Tagline:** The personal operating system for a better life.

## Overview

LifeOS AI is a holistic personal assistant that organizes health, finances, career, and well-being into one clear system. Built with a calm, trust-first approach - designed for long-term everyday use, not pressure or hype.

## The Problem

People use dozens of apps to manage parts of their lives — money, health, work, stress — all separately. This fragmentation causes:
- Hidden risks
- Delayed action
- Chronic anxiety about the future
- **There is no single system that shows life as a whole**

- ✅ Unified life overview
- ✅ Practical daily guidance
- ✅ Calm future outlook
- ✅ AI-powered insights
